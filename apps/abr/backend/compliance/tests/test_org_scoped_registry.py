"""
Contract tests: every model that stores org-scoped data must derive from
OrganizationModel (or carry an explicit `organization` FK to OrganizationModel).

These tests enforce the invariant introduced in NzilaOS alignment Item 8.
Run with: pytest backend/compliance/tests/test_org_scoped_registry.py -v
