/**
 * Domain-Driven Schema Exports
 * 
 * Consolidated schema exports organized by business domain.
 * 
 * This replaces the flat 75-file structure with 13 domain modules,
 * reducing import depth from 5 to 2 levels and eliminating 18 duplicates.
 * 
 * Migration Status: Phase 2 Complete - Domain Structure Created
 * Next: Phase 3 - Migrate individual schemas into domain folders
 * 
 * @see SCHEMA_CONSOLIDATION_DESIGN.md for full consolidation plan
