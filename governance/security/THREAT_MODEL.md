### R — Repudiation

| ID | Threat | Component | Mitigation | Status |
|----|--------|-----------|------------|--------|
| R-01 | Denied governance action | Governance module | Every action produces audit_event with actor ID, timestamp, hash | ✅ Mitigated |
| R-02 | Denied document upload | Blob storage | Upload creates audit_event + document row with SHA-256 | ✅ Mitigated |
| R-03 | Denied financial operation | QBO/Stripe | Payment events normalized and persisted with Stripe event ID | ✅ Mitigated |
| R-04 | Denied access change | RBAC | Entity membership changes logged with before/after JSON | ✅ Mitigated |
| R-05 | Denied AI action | AI Gateway | Action attestation documents with approval workflow | ✅ Mitigated |

### I — Information Disclosure

| ID | Threat | Component | Mitigation | Status |

## 3. Risk Matrix

| Risk Level | Count | IDs |
|------------|-------|-----|
| ✅ Fully Mitigated | 27 | S-01, S-02, S-04, S-05, T-01–T-06, R-01–R-05, I-01–I-06, D-02–D-05, E-01–E-05 |
| ⚠️ Partially Mitigated | 2 | S-03 (mTLS pending), D-01 (rate limiting) |
| ❌ Unmitigated | 0 | — |

## 4. Residual Risks & Acceptance

### S-03: Service-to-service spoofing
- **Current state:** Request ID propagation provides correlation but not authentication
- **Planned mitigation:** mTLS between Container Apps (Azure-native)
- **Risk acceptance:** Low probability in Azure VNet; mitigated by environment isolation
- **Target date:** Q3 2026

### D-01: API rate limiting
- **Current state:** Clerk provides basic rate limiting; no custom per-endpoint throttling
- **Planned mitigation:** Azure API Management or custom middleware rate limiter
- **Risk acceptance:** Clerk's built-in protection sufficient for current scale
- **Target date:** Q2 2026
