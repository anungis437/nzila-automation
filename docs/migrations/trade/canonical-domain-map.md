# Trade — Canonical Domain Map

> **Status:** Active  
> **Owner:** Platform team  
> **Last updated:** 2026-02-27

## Purpose

This document defines the **canonical domain model** for the unified Trade platform
within NzilaOS. It supersedes both legacy Trade-OS (Django) and eExports (Django)
applications. Trade-OS provides the preferred structural basis; eExports contributes
cars-vertical depth that is encapsulated behind a vertical boundary.

## Core Domain (Generic — Commodity-Neutral)

All core domain entities are **org-scoped** (`entity_id` FK to `entities`), use
**audited mutations** (hash-chained), and produce **evidence packs** at terminal
states.

## Deal FSM (Finite State Machine)

```
lead → qualified → quoted → accepted → funded → shipped → delivered → closed
```

### Transition Rules

| From | To | Allowed Roles | Evidence Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| lead | qualified | admin, seller, broker | No |
| qualified | quoted | admin, seller | No |
| quoted | accepted | admin, buyer | **Yes** — quote acceptance pack |
| accepted | funded | admin, seller | No |
| funded | shipped | admin, seller | **Yes** — shipment docs pack |
| shipped | delivered | admin, seller, buyer | No |
| delivered | closed | admin | **Yes** — commission settlement pack |

### Terminal States

- `closed` — fully completed
- (any stage can be `cancelled` — separate status, not part of main FSM)

### Evidence Packs (Terminal Stages)

| Pack | Triggered At | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `quote_acceptance_pack` | `quoted → accepted` | Quote hash + parties + timestamp |
| `shipment_docs_pack` | `funded → shipped` | Hash chain of required documents |
| `commission_settlement_pack` | `delivered → closed` | Policy + calculation + final amount |

## Audit Trail

Every mutation produces an `AuditEntry` following the `@nzila/commerce-audit` pattern:
- `entityType`: `trade_deal`, `trade_quote`, `trade_listing`, etc.
- `action`: `created`, `updated`, `transitioned`, `deleted`
- Hash-chained for integrity verification via `@nzila/os-core`

---

## Integration Events

Published via `@nzila/integrations-runtime` dispatcher:

| Event | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `trade.deal.created` | New deal |
| `trade.quote.sent` | Quote sent to buyer |
| `trade.quote.accepted` | Quote accepted |
| `trade.shipment.milestone` | Shipment milestone updated |
| `trade.document.uploaded` | New document attached |
| `trade.commission.finalized` | Commission finalized |

---

## Package Topology

```
packages/trade-core      → types, enums, schemas, FSM definitions (pure TS)
packages/trade-db         → Drizzle schema, repositories (org-scoped)
packages/trade-adapters   → legacy import adapters, external integrations
packages/trade-cars       → vehicle vertical types, UI components, helpers

apps/trade                → Next.js app (consumes all trade packages)
```

### Import Rules

- `trade-core` may NOT import from any other trade package
- `trade-db` may import from `trade-core` only
- `trade-adapters` may import from `trade-core` and `trade-db`
- `trade-cars` may import from `trade-core` only (no DB dependency)
- `apps/trade` may import from ALL trade packages
- **Core packages may NOT import from `trade-cars`** (vertical boundary)
