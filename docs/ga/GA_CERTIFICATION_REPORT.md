## Prerequisites

Before executing this report, confirm all of the following are merged to `main`:

- [ ] REM-01 — Rate limiting (Arcjet on console + partners)
- [ ] REM-02 — Org isolation runtime test harness (5 HTTP-level tests passing)
- [ ] REM-03 — Privilege escalation regression tests
- [ ] REM-04 — `DATA_EXPORT` audit action + route wiring
- [ ] REM-05 — Health/readiness routes (console + partners)
- [ ] REM-11 — Audit DB-level write constraint (PostgreSQL trigger or RLS)
- [ ] REM-12 — GitHub branch protection on `main` configured
- [ ] REM-13 — Org ID injected into `RequestContext` and every log entry

Then run: `pnpm contract-tests` — all must pass before proceeding.  
Expected baseline: ≥ 290 tests pass, 0 fail.

## Section 5.1 — Cross-Org Data Read Attempt

**Objective:** Prove that Org B cannot read Org A's data via HTTP.

**Method:**
1. Seed Org A resource via test fixture (`tooling/contract-tests/fixtures/orgs.ts`)
2. Issue GET request to that resource using Org B's session headers
3. Confirm response is 403 (or 404 if enumeration protection is active)
4. Confirm response body does not contain Org A's ID or data

**Result:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Test file | `tooling/contract-tests/org-isolation-runtime.test.ts` |
| Test name | "A. Cross-org READ blocked — OrgB cannot GET OrgA resource" |
| Response status | ___ |
| Response body leaked Org A data | Yes / No |
| Pass / Fail | ___ |

**Evidence (paste test output):**
```

```

## Section 5.2 — Privilege Escalation Attempt

**Objective:** Prove that a `console:admin` session cannot invoke a `console:super_admin`-only action.

**Method:**
1. Call a `SUPER_ADMIN`-scoped route with `console:admin` session token
2. Confirm response is 403
3. Confirm an `AUTHORIZATION_DENIED` audit event was emitted

**Result:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Test file | `tooling/contract-tests/privilege-escalation.test.ts` |
| Test name | "console:admin cannot call a console:super_admin-only action" |
| Response status | ___ |
| Audit event emitted | Yes / No |
| Pass / Fail | ___ |

**Evidence (paste test output):**
```
(paste here)
```

## Section 5.3 — Audit Tampering Attempt

**Objective:** Prove that the `audit_events` table cannot be silently modified.

**Method A — Application layer:** Call `verifyEntityAuditChain(orgId)` after seeding 5 events. Confirm chain is valid.  
**Method B — DB layer (REM-11 must be merged):** Attempt a direct `UPDATE audit_events SET severity = 'low' WHERE id = <id>` via raw DB query. Confirm PostgreSQL raises an error.

**Result:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Chain verification | Pass / Fail |
| DB trigger blocks UPDATE | Pass / Fail / Not yet configured |
| Test file | `tooling/contract-tests/audit-immutability.test.ts` |
| Pass / Fail | ___ |

**Evidence:**
```
(paste here)
```

## Section 5.4 — Rate Limit Trigger

**Objective:** Confirm Next.js apps return 429 under load.

**Method:**
1. Set `ARCJET_ENV=test` with a very low bucket capacity (e.g., 3 requests/minute for test run)
2. Issue 5 rapid requests to a protected console API route
3. Confirm ≥ 1 response is `429 Too Many Requests`

**Result:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| App tested | console / partners |
| Request count before 429 | ___ |
| 429 returned | Yes / No |
| Pass / Fail | ___ |

**Evidence:**
```
(paste here)
```

## Section 5.5 — Dependency Vulnerability CI Block

**Objective:** Confirm CI fails when a CRITICAL vulnerability is introduced.

**Method:**
1. On a scratch branch, add a known-vulnerable package pinned to a CRITICAL version
2. Push branch
3. Confirm `dependency-audit` CI job fails with exit 1

**Result:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Test branch | ___ |
| CI run URL | ___ |
| `dependency-audit` job | FAILED / PASSED (expected: FAILED) |
| Pass / Fail | ___ |

---

## Section 5.6 — CI Enforcement Confirmation

**Objective:** Confirm that all security-critical CI jobs are required checks on `main`.

**Method:**
1. Navigate to repo Settings → Branches → main → Branch protection rules
2. Capture the list of required status checks

**Required checks (must all be present):**

| Check | Present |
|-------|---------|
| `lint-and-typecheck` | ☐ |
| `test` | ☐ |
| `build` | ☐ |
| `contract-tests` | ☐ |
| `secret-scan` (or link from `secret-scan.yml`) | ☐ |
| `dependency-audit` | ☐ |
| `trivy` | ☐ |
| Require PR before merging | ☐ |
| Dismiss stale reviews on push | ☐ |

**Evidence (screenshot or `gh api` output):**
```
(paste here)
